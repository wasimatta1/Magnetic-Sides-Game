# Magnetic Sides Game

## Description

Magnetic Sides Game is a project developed as part of an AI course. The game involves two players competing against each other on a grid-based board. Each player takes turns placing magnetic pieces on the board, and the goal is to create chains of magnets by matching sides with opposite polarities. The game is played until one player successfully creates a specified number of chains or the board is filled. The minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning is implemented to determine the optimal moves for the AI player.

## Features

- Interactive grid-based gameplay.
- Implementation of the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for AI decision-making.
- Adjustable game parameters such as board size, number of chains required to win, and difficulty level.
